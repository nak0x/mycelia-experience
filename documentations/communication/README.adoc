= 📡 Communication

For this project we will have to create a experience in a controlled environnement
thus giving us the possibility of a constant wifi connection through a router.
This, and the fact that WebSockets are easy, fast, reliable way to do live
connections, we are going to use as much WebSockets as possible.

We are also going to use API calls, since they are even easier to performs and can
be really powerfull to sequence the experience.

We MUST also user Bluetooth connection from IPhones to a Bolt Sphero, and a RVR.

To communicate, we have decided to use a common JSON spec. xref:spec/README.adoc[Read the spec here.]
