= project template for esp32 c++

this serves as a small project template that works with esp_idf build and flash. you can copy the directory, where ever you need.
you then need to replace all the mention of `project-template` with your project name / app name / service name whatever.

it come with a pretty make file that can be use alongside envrionnement variables to build/clean/setup/monitor/flash
the app.

== Make commands documentations

=== Build workflow

This project template includes a `Makefile` that wraps common `idf.py` commands, making the workflow shorter and more consistent.  
All commands can optionally take environment variables such as `PORT` or `BAUD`:

----
make PORT=/dev/tty.usbserial-0001 BAUD=921600 flash
----

If not provided, defaults from the `Makefile` are used.

=== Commands

==== `make config`
Initializes the ESP-IDF target for this project:

----
idf.py set-target esp32
----

This generates (or regenerates) the `sdkconfig` file for ESP32.

----

==== `make all`
Builds the entire project:

----
idf.py build
----

This compiles the application, bootloader, partition table and produces the final firmware binaries.

----

==== `make flash`
Flashes the compiled firmware to the board:

----
idf.py -p $PORT -b $BAUD flash
----

- `PORT` sets the serial device (default: `/dev/cu.usbserial-0001`)
- `BAUD` sets the upload baudrate (default: `115200`)

----

==== `make monitor`
Opens a serial monitor connected to the device:

----
idf.py -p $PORT monitor
----

This displays the runtime logs produced by the application.  
Exit with `Ctrl+]` then `q`.

----

==== `make flash-monitor`
Flashes the firmware and immediately attaches the serial monitor:

----
idf.py -p $PORT flash monitor
----

Useful when iterating quickly during development.

----

==== `make clean`
Removes the build directory:

----
idf.py clean
----

This forces a full recompilation on the next `make all`.
